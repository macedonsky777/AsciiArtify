# Deploying Hello-World App with ArgoCD

## Description

Deploying hello-world app website that listens on port 80 with ArgoCD. In this demo, I show how ArgoCD watches the repository with the deployment configuration and deploys a second replica of the pod when the replica count is changed. After that, I expose the port through port-forward to the newly created pod and open the website on localhost.
